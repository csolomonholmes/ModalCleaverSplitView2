        <p>The application of this concept extends the possibilities for a Cordova (iOS) app.</p>
        <p>By making a Cordova (iOS) "a little less hybrid" alot of possibilities arise that a standard implementation of Cordova (iOS) in a single webview doesn't allow.</p>
        <p>Of coarse using this method to build a PhoneGap app has a couple drawbacks. The first being, the app in this state losses cross platform compatibility because more UI elements are dependent on native classes. Second, a better understanding of obj-C is needed.</p>
        <p>If you can live with that then this method is something that should be investigated.</p>
        <p>After building several examples using this method i've concluded that there are several benefits that ought to be emphasized.</p>
        <p>First, by using multiple webViews, each instance of your html5 UI is slimmer. This avoids a common issue when using larger js libraries to drive the app UI. In the past I've used Sencha Touch to create my UI elements and have found that loading a Sencha Touch app into a single webview seriously detracts from the overall user experience due to slower initial load time and sluggish handling of embedded images.</p>
        <br><p>more to come...</p>
        <p>This project is dependent on CordovaLib and was written using Xcode 4.3.2 and Cordova 1.7.0 and targets iOS 5.1</center></p>
